7</span>MARSK STIG&rsquo;S DAUGHTERS</h2>
<p>Two daughters fair the Marshal had,<br />
O grievous was their fate and sad.</p>
<p>The eldest she took her sister&rsquo;s hand<br />
And away they went to Sweden&rsquo;s land.</p>
<p>Home from the Stevn King Byrgye rode;<br />
Up to him Marsk Stig&rsquo;s daughters trode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What women ye who beset my gate?<br />
What brings ye hither at eve so late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughters of Stig, the Marshal brave,<br />
So earnestly thee for help we crave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence, hence away, ye outcasts two,<br />
Your sire accurst my uncle slew.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Guiltless are we of Erik&rsquo;s blood,<br />
So wide we wander in quest of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eldest she takes her sister&rsquo;s hand,<br />
And away they went into Norway&rsquo;s land.</p>
<p>Home from the Ting King Erik rode<br />
Up to him Marsk Stig&rsquo;s daughters trode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What women are ye whom here I view,<br />
And what may ye in my country do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughters of Stig, the Marshal brave<br />
So earnestly thee for help we crave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To brew and bake full well ye know&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Alas, Sir King, not so, not so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To brew and bake we do not know,<br />
We never stoop&rsquo;d to employ so low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To spin red gold that is our pride,<br />
Our mother taught us ere she died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we can weave galloon as well<br />
As the maidens with the Queen that dwell.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;We can weave red gold with wool,<br />
But oh, our hearts with grief are full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Marsk Stig stay&rsquo;d in Denmark green,<br />
Different far our fate had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Ingeborg not chanc&rsquo;d to die,<br />
We had not borne this misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Erik replied in gentle tone:<br />
&ldquo;I knew your father like my own;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a man in heart and hand,<br />
Whose like lives not in any land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er them he threw his mantle red,<br />
To the ladies&rsquo; chamber them he led.</p>
<p>He bade them no more tears to shed,<br />
For he would stand in their father&rsquo;s stead.</p>
<p>The eldest sister began the weft,<br />
The youngest finished what she left.</p>
<p>In the first lace she wove so true<br />
The Virgin Mary and Christ Jesu.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>And in the second of Norway land<br />
She wove the Queen and her maiden band.</p>
<p>Of the antler&rsquo;d hart they wove the chase,<br />
They wove themselves with pallid face.</p>
<p>They wove with nimble fingers small<br />
Of God the holy Angels all.</p>
<p>The youngest sister the woof up caught,<br />
And that before the Queen she brought.</p>
<p>Then into her eyes the tears they came,<br />
&ldquo;Thou art not our Mother, Queenly Dame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wert thou our mother or sister dear,<br />
With praises thou our hearts wouldst cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in thine eye no praise I see,<br />
Misfortune is our destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eldest sicken&rsquo;d, and sick she lay,<br />
The youngest tended her night and day.</p>
<p>The eldest died of grief of heart,<br />
The youngest liv&rsquo;d with sorrow and smart.</p>

11</span>THE THREE EXPECTANTS</h2>
<p>There are three for my death that now pine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though one and all wondrous civil;<br />
Would that all of them hung on a line,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My children, the worms, and the Devil.</p>
<p>My body, my soul, and my gear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When down to the grave I descend,<br />
The three hope among them to share,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to revel on time without end.</p>
<p>But there is not one of the three,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the others though kindly affected,<br />
For both of their shares would agree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To resign his own portion expected.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>The Devil, so harsh and austere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who only in evil hath joy,<br />
Would scorn to take body and gear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For my soul, that sweet beautiful toy.</p>
<p>My children would rather possess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gear I have toil&rsquo;d so to gather,<br />
Though for me fervent love they profess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the body and soul of their father.</p>
<p>The worms, though my children will make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A lament when I&rsquo;m laid in the hole,<br />
Would my body in preference take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To my gear or my beautiful soul.</p>
<p>Oh, Christ! who wast hung on a tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wast pierc&rsquo;d by a fool in his madness;<br
/>
Since each of them plund&rsquo;ring would be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Send each disappointment and sadness.</p>

13</span>TRANSLATION</h2>
<p>One summer morn, as I was seeking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My ponies in their green retreat,<br />
I heard a lady sing a ditty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me which sounded strangely sweet.</p>
<p><i>I am the ladye</i>, <i>I am the ladye</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I am the ladye loving the knight</i>;<br />
<i>I in the green wood &rsquo;neath the green branches</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In the night season sleep with the
knight</i>.</p>
<p>Since yonder summer morn of beauty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen many a gloomy year;<br />
But in my mind still lives the ditty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in the green wood met my ear.</p>
<p><i>I am the ladye</i>, <i>I am the ladye</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I am the ladye loving the knight</i>;<br />
<i>I in the green wood &rsquo;neath the green branches</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In the night season sleep with the
knight</i>.</p>

14</span>THE ENGLISH GIPSY</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>He</i></p>
<p>As I to the town was going one day<br />
My Roman lass I met by the way.<br />
Said I, &ldquo;Young maid, will you share my lot?&rdquo;<br />
Said she, &ldquo;Another wife you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ah, no!&rdquo; to my Roman lass I cried,<br />
&ldquo;No wife have I in the world so wide;<br />
And you my wedded wife shall be,<br />
If you will consent to come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>She</i></p>

<p>Up, up, brothers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cease your revels!<br />
The Gentile&rsquo;s coming&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Run like devils.</p>
<p>I do not like your way of life<br />

All, all to oppose<br />
Their numerous foes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Romany need.</p>
<p>Our horses they take,<br />
Our wagons they break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And us they seize<br />
In their prisons to coop,<br />
Where we pine and droop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For want of breeze.</p>
<p>When the dead swallow<br />
The fly shall follow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the sea,<br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
